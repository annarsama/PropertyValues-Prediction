# Property Values Prediction

This is the final project for a Machine Learning lesson from **Master 2 SISE** (Data Science) at the _Universit√© Lumi√®re Lyon 2_. The aim of this project was to build an application using Dash to predict property values. Here, there is only a Jupyter Notebook with steps we followed to analyse the data. The app is available [here](https://github.com/LeoGondouin/ML_Python) (and more information regarding this project).

## App Folder üñ•Ô∏è

On this repository, there is only a Jupyter Notebook with steps we followed to analyse the data. The app is available [here](https://github.com/LeoGondouin/ML_Python) (and more information regarding this project).

## Data üìç

We used about 3 million actual public data from [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/demandes-de-valeurs-foncieres/), which are about property values from 2018 to 2021 years.

## Machine Learning üìä

We first ran **classification algorithms**, including decision trees and k-Nearest Neighbors (with and/or without GridSearch), to predict the target "Type local" given relevant features. This first target then helped us to predict property values using **regression algorithms** such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
